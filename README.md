## Functionality
### Side Panel
This is where you can create a new task, show a list of all tasks, or those sorted by list name or priority.
The list and priority links have a drop down menu of each category.

### Task List Panel
All of the tasks requested will show in this panel. The list can be sorted by date by clicking due date at the top along with the list and priority links at the side menu.
When finished with a task click the checkbox next to the task, this will delete the item.

### Single Task Panel
There are five details you can modify on each task.
  * Task Name
  * Task Notes
  * Due Date
  * Priority Level
  * List Name

### Create Task Module
Creates a task with the five details listed above.
